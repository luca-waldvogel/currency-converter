# 💱 Currency Converter (C++)

In my role as **Customer Care International Sales**, I frequently handled **currency conversions** using quarterly defined exchange rates.  
To streamline this process, I developed this **C++ program**, which allows me to:

- Convert multiple amounts quickly (EUR ⇄ CHF)  
- Apply the correct exchange rate once for all values  
- Generate a **clear, formatted list** that can be shared directly with **customers** or **internal sales representatives**

## ✨ Features
- Input an exchange rate (EUR ↔ CHF)
- Convert **1–15 amounts** in one run
- Choose conversion direction:
  - EUR ➝ CHF
  - CHF ➝ EUR
- Robust input validation:
  - Only numbers allowed
  - Range checks for the number of amounts
- Option to **restart** or **exit** the program after each run
- Nicely **formatted output** (2 decimal places)
